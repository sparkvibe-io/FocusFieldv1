## üîê Permissions

The app requires microphone access to measure ambient noise levels:

- **iOS**: Added `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist
- **Android**: Added `RECORD_AUDIO` permission in AndroidManifest.xml

**Privacy Note**: No audio is recorded or stored - the app only measures decibel levels in real-time for silence detection.
