## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.x or higher
- Dart 3.x or higher
- iOS 15.0+ (raised due to Firebase/Firestore & RevenueCat SDK requirements) or Android API level 21+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/silence-score.git
cd silence-score
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Configure Environment** (Important):
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
# Get RevenueCat API key from: https://app.revenuecat.com/projects
vim .env
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
# Development build (with mock subscriptions)
./scripts/build-dev.sh

# Or run directly with Flutter
flutter run --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Environment Configuration

The app uses environment variables for secure API key management:

- **Development**: Uses `.env` file and mock subscriptions by default
- **Production**: Requires actual API keys and disables mocks

**Environment Variables:**
- `REVENUECAT_API_KEY`: RevenueCat subscription management
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase services (optional)
- `IS_DEVELOPMENT`: Enable/disable development mode
- `ENABLE_MOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS`: Use mock payments for testing

### Building for Production

#### Android
```bash
# Using the secure build script (recommended)
export REVENUECAT_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"
./scripts/build-prod.sh

# Or manually with dart-define
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key
```

#### iOS
```bash
# Set environment variables
export REVENUECAT_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"

# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release \
  --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY="$REVENUECAT_API_KEY" \
  --dart-define=IS_DEVELOPMENT=false \
  --dart-define=ENABLE_MOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS=false
```

#### Development Builds
```bash
# Quick development build with environment file
./scripts/build-dev.sh

# Or run in debug mode
flutter run
```

## üîê Permissions

The app requires microphone access to measure ambient noise levels:

- **iOS**: Added `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist
- **Android**: Added `RECORD_AUDIO` permission in AndroidManifest.xml

**Privacy Note**: No audio is recorded or stored - the app only measures decibel levels in real-time for silence detection. A shared cached permission Future prevents duplicate OS dialogs.

## üîî Notification System

SilenceScore includes a flexible, privacy‚Äëfriendly local notification system designed to reinforce habit formation without being spammy.

### Architecture
| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `NotificationService` | Core API: smart reminder logic, scheduling (daily / weekly), achievement & session notifications |
| `NotificationPermissionHandler` | Isolated permission checks & requests (Android 13+ POST_NOTIFICATIONS, iOS alert/badge/sound) |
| `notification_settings_widget.dart` | User interface for enabling features & picking schedule overrides |
| SharedPreferences (StorageService) | Persists user scheduling overrides (daily time, weekly weekday/time) & last reminder sent date |

### Features
1. Smart Daily Reminders
  - Learns your preferred practice window from recent session start times (keeps last 30) and triggers within ¬±30 minutes of the most common time.
  - Optional explicit time override: user can pick a fixed daily reminder time; reverting to Smart re-enables adaptive behavior.
2. Weekly Progress Summary (Premium)
  - User‚Äëselectable weekday + time (default Monday @ 09:00) summarizing weekly engagement.
3. Session Completion Notifications
  - Instant feedback when a session finishes (success vs incomplete messaging).
4. Achievement Notifications
  - Milestone unlock messages (first session, streaks, perfect/long sessions, etc.).
5. Adaptive Messaging
  - Reminder & streak copy adjusts to current streak length and total session count.
6. Testability
  - Injected `NowProvider` enables deterministic unit tests; separate permission handler allows logic testing without platform channels.

### Scheduling Behavior
Daily: Uses user override (if set) else computed optimal hour/minute; scheduled with `matchDateTimeComponents: time` so it repeats daily.  
Weekly: Uses stored weekday & time with `matchDateTimeComponents: dayOfWeekAndTime`.  
Both rely on the `timezone` package; zones initialized on service init (skipped in tests).

### Persistence Keys
`dailyReminderHour`, `dailyReminderMinute`, `weeklySummaryWeekday`, `weeklySummaryHour`, `weeklySummaryMinute`, and `last_reminder` (for per‚Äëday guard).

### User Flow
1. User opens Notification Settings sheet; if permission missing, a banner prompts enablement.  
2. Toggling Daily Reminders or Weekly Summary triggers (re) scheduling immediately.  
3. Selecting a time or weekday updates SharedPreferences and reschedules.  
4. Choosing "Use Smart" clears daily fixed time keys and reverts to adaptive reminder scheduling.

### Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
- Dynamic weekly summary body generation at fire time (currently placeholder text).  
- Advanced analytics injection for richer weekly insights.  
- Quiet hours / do-not-disturb awareness.  
- A/B messaging variants & localization coverage expansion.

### Testing
Unit tests cover smart reminder eligibility (`shouldSendDailyReminder`) with injected clock and controlled session history. Additional scheduling tests verify that enabling features with overrides places correct schedule parameters (see `test/notification_service_test.dart`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development
### Internationalization (i18n)

The app uses Flutter `gen-l10n` with multiple fully integrated locales.

Supported locales: `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`, `pt_BR`, `ja`.

#### Notification & Dynamic Message Localization
All notification strings (settings UI, reminders, achievements, weekly summaries, streak copy) are fully localized across supported locales.

Dynamic strings with placeholders use explicit metadata blocks in each non‚ÄëEnglish ARB (e.g. `@reminderStreakShort`, `@weeklyProgressFew`) to ensure typed method generation (`int streak`, `int count`). This avoids accidental `Object` parameter generation and keeps runtime type safety.

Streak tiers implemented:
- `reminderStreakShort` ‚Äì early streak encouragement
- `reminderStreakMedium` ‚Äì mid milestone motivation
- `reminderStreakLong` ‚Äì long streak celebration

Weekly progress variants:
- `weeklyProgressFew`
- `weeklyProgressSome`
- `weeklyProgressPerfect`

Fixed two‚Äëday copy (`reminderDayTwo`) intentionally kept static (no placeholder) to remove unnecessary function signatures.

#### Adding / Updating Translations
1. Add or edit keys in `app_en.arb` (source of truth). Include `@key` metadata for any placeholder variables.
2. Copy the new key to every other `app_<locale>.arb` with either a real translation or temporary English placeholder.
3. If the string has placeholders, also add the matching `@key` metadata in each locale (copy from English, do not translate placeholder names).
4. Run:
  ```bash
  flutter gen-l10n
  ```
5. Run tests (includes interpolation + completeness checks):
  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```
6. Replace any temporary placeholders with real translations before release.

#### Translation Quality & Style
- Keep punctuation and emoji usage parallel to English where culturally appropriate.
- Avoid translating variable names.
- Preserve capitalization segmentation if it impacts accessibility (screen readers often break on emoji + punctuation).
- Prefer concise motivational tone for reminders; avoid overly formal phrasing.

#### Validation Tests
Added dedicated tests to guard localization integrity:
- `localization_smoke_test.dart` (English interpolation)
- `localization_de_test.dart`, `localization_es_test.dart`, `localization_pt_test.dart`, `localization_pt_br_test.dart`, `localization_ja_test.dart` (per‚Äëlocale interpolation checks)
- `localization_completeness_test.dart` ensures every locale ARB contains all keys from English (excludes metadata keys starting with `@`).

If a new locale is introduced without all keys, the completeness test will fail, preventing silent partial localization regressions.

#### Common Pitfalls Prevented
- Missing placeholder metadata ‚Üí would generate `Object` parameter types (guarded by convention + tests).
- Untranslated new key in one locale ‚Üí caught by completeness test.
- Placeholder name mismatch ‚Üí `flutter gen-l10n` failure (resolve by copying `@key` entry exactly).

#### Future i18n Enhancements
- Automated extraction & translation pipeline (e.g. using a script to diff new keys and produce a translator handoff JSON/CSV).
- Pluralization for weekly summaries if variant granularity increases.
- Fallback locale smoke test during CI launch build.

Key files:
- `l10n/l10n.yaml` ‚Äì configuration
- `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` ‚Äì source of truth
- `lib/l10n/app_*.arb` ‚Äì translated locale files
- Generated: `lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart` (do not edit manually)

Add a new locale:
1. Duplicate `app_en.arb` to `app_xx.arb`.
2. Translate values; preserve placeholder keys.
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` (or just `flutter run`).
4. Ensure the new locale is included in `supportedLocales` if not auto-wired.
5. Validate UI for overflow & multi-byte glyph rendering.
6. Provide translation metadata (`@key` objects) for complex strings / achievements.

Notes:
- Placeholders must match exactly; don't translate variable names.
- Avoid hard-coded text in widgets; everything user-facing should be localized.
- Use plural formatting where counts vary (see `minutesOfSilenceCongrats`).
 - Run `flutter gen-l10n` after any ARB change; commit regenerated files.
 - Completeness & interpolation tests enforce consistency‚Äîkeep them green before merging.

Translation backlog (if any) is tracked via `untranslated_messages.txt` when running `flutter gen-l10n`.

## üí∞ Monetization & Subscription System

### Status: ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented (Docs & Dynamic Pricing Update In Progress)

SilenceScore includes a RevenueCat-based subscription system with dynamic product pricing (fetched from live store offerings when available) and a mock mode for local development.

#### Core Infrastructure
- RevenueCat integration via `purchases_flutter`
- Tiered access: Free, Premium, Premium Plus (future expansion)
- Feature gating with `FeatureGate` + Riverpod providers
- Custom paywall (`PaywallWidget`) currently showing dynamic prices when offerings load; will evolve to remote-config / A/B capable layout
- Mock mode (`ENABLE_MOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS=true`) for development without store connections

#### Product Identifiers (Current)
```
premium.tier:monthly
premium.tier:yearly
```
(Verify colon usage is accepted by both stores; if not, migrate to `premium.tier.monthly` & `premium.tier.yearly`.)

#### Pricing (Live via RevenueCat)
- Prices and localized currency are pulled dynamically from RevenueCat Paywall/Offerings.
- Legacy fallback values (1.99 / 19.99) remain in code only if offerings fail to load.

#### Key Environment Flags
- `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` (required for production builds)
- `IS_DEVELOPMENT` (default true locally)
- `ENABLE_MOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS` (set false for real purchases)

#### Launch Readiness Checklist (Remaining)
1. Add legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms) to paywall footer
2. Confirm introductory offers / trials (if desired) configured in stores & RevenueCat
3. Turn off mock mode in production build scripts
4. QA sandbox purchases on iOS & internal testing on Android
5. Add refund / manage subscription help link (store-specific deep link)

#### Premium (Phase 1 Active)
- Extended sessions (60m vs 5m free)
- Advanced analytics
- Data export (CSV/PDF)
- Premium themes
- Priority support

#### Future Higher Tier (Deferred)
- Cloud sync, AI insights, multi-environments, social features (not active yet)

#### Notes
- Migration to the official RevenueCat Paywall (for localization & trials) is planned; current widget is an interim custom layout showing dynamic prices.
- Static numeric pricing in `SubscriptionTier` remains only as a fallback.

For detailed setup steps see `docs/MONETIZATION_SETUP.md` (will be updated to reflect the above identifiers and pricing alignment).
