## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.x or higher
- Dart 3.x or higher
- iOS 13.0+ or Android API level 21+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/silence-score.git
cd silence-score
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Configure Environment** (Important):
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
# Get RevenueCat API key from: https://app.revenuecat.com/projects
vim .env
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
# Development build (with mock subscriptions)
./scripts/build-dev.sh

# Or run directly with Flutter
flutter run --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Environment Configuration

The app uses environment variables for secure API key management:

- **Development**: Uses `.env` file and mock subscriptions by default
- **Production**: Requires actual API keys and disables mocks

**Environment Variables:**
- `REVENUECAT_API_KEY`: RevenueCat subscription management
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase services (optional)
- `IS_DEVELOPMENT`: Enable/disable development mode
- `ENABLE_MOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS`: Use mock payments for testing

### Building for Production

#### Android
```bash
# Using the secure build script (recommended)
export REVENUECAT_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"
./scripts/build-prod.sh

# Or manually with dart-define
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=your_key
```

#### iOS
```bash
# Set environment variables
export REVENUECAT_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"

# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release \
  --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY="$REVENUECAT_API_KEY" \
  --dart-define=IS_DEVELOPMENT=false \
  --dart-define=ENABLE_MOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS=false
```

#### Development Builds
```bash
# Quick development build with environment file
./scripts/build-dev.sh

# Or run in debug mode
flutter run
```

## üîê Permissions

The app requires microphone access to measure ambient noise levels:

- **iOS**: Added `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist
- **Android**: Added `RECORD_AUDIO` permission in AndroidManifest.xml

**Privacy Note**: No audio is recorded or stored - the app only measures decibel levels in real-time for silence detection.

#### Real-Time Chart Not Working
- **Cause**: Memory issues or invalid data processing
- **Solution**: Chart will show "temporarily unavailable" and auto-recover
- **Prevention**: v0.1.1 includes chart stability improvements and error boundaries

#### Microphone Permission Issues
- **iOS**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone > Silence Score
- **Android**: Settings > Apps > Silence Score > Permissions > Microphone
- **Note**: App now provides better guidance for permission setup

#### Audio Processing Errors & Native Buffer Crashes
- **Cause**: Native audio buffer errors from underlying noise_meter package
- **Symptoms**: App crashes with "AudioReaderError" or similar native errors
- **Solution**: App now includes automatic recovery - chart shows "recovering" message
- **Prevention**: v0.1.1 includes comprehensive audio crash protection with:
  - Native error detection and graceful handling
  - Automatic component recovery with exponential backoff
  - Audio resource management and cleanup
