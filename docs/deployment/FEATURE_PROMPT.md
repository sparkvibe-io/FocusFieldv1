Create a 1024x500px horizontal banner (feature graphic) for the Google Play Store showcasing "Focus Field" - a
  first-to-market silence measurement and focus tracking application.

  Core Visual Concept:

  Design a wide-format banner that tells the story of transformation from noise to silence, chaos to calm, distraction to deep focus. This should capture the app's unique value proposition: measuring ambient quietness to build focus habits through compassionate progression.

  Layout & Composition (1024x500px):

  Left and Center Third (0-680px):
  - Starting state: Visual representation of ambient noise/chaos
  - Chaotic sound waves, scattered particles, or environmental noise indicators
  - Warmer, more energetic colors (teal/blue spectrum beginning)
  - Suggests the problem: noisy environment disrupting focus

  Right Third (680-1024px):
  - Transformation zone: The "Focus Field" in action
  - Central focal point: Elegant circular progress ring or protective field
  - Sound waves being absorbed/dampened in real-time
  - Concentric circles or ripples suggesting measurement and monitoring
  - App UI elements subtly visible (progress indicators, ambient score visualization)
  - This is the hero moment - the app actively creating focus space


  Material 3 Design Principles:

  Color System:
  - Primary: Deep calming teals (#006D77, #0A9396) - representing focus and measurement
  - Secondary: Soft purples (#7209B7, #B5179E) - premium quality and achievement
  - Tertiary: Accent gold/amber (#FFB703) - sparingly for success states
  - Surface: Clean whites (#FEFEFE) as background base
  - Use Material 3 dynamic color principles with tonal palettes
  - Gradient transitions should be smooth and purposeful (left to right progression)

  Typography (if including text):
  - Use Roboto or Google Sans (Material 3 standard)
  - App name "Focus Field" in large, bold weight (48-60pt)
  - Tagline option: "Measure Silence. Build Focus." (24-32pt, medium weight)
  - Position text in upper-left or center-left for readability
  - Ensure high contrast against background (WCAG AA minimum)
  - Consider text-free version - let visuals tell the story

  Visual Style:
  - Modern minimalism - clean lines, purposeful negative space
  - Geometric precision with organic flow (technological + zen harmony)
  - Depth through subtle elevation and shadow (Material 3 elevation system)
  - Use motion blur or particle effects to suggest real-time monitoring
  - Avoid flat design - embrace subtle dimensionality and depth

  Key Visual Elements:

  1. Central Hero Element:
    - Large circular progress ring or "focus field" (200-300px diameter)
    - Glowing edge with subtle animation feel (motion lines)
    - Interior showing ambient score visualization (70% threshold indicator)
    - Sound wave particles being absorbed at the boundary
  2. Background Treatment:
    - Subtle gradient (left warmer → right cooler)
    - Abstract sound wave patterns that dissipate left-to-right
    - Soft radial glow from center suggesting protective field
    - Clean enough to not compete with foreground elements
  3. Supplementary Elements:
    - 2-3 floating UI cards showing app features (session timer, streak counter, quest progress)
    - Miniature app icon in top-left corner for brand recognition
    - Subtle grid or measurement markers suggesting scientific precision
    - Achievement badges or streak indicators (non-gamified, sophisticated)

  Material 3 Component Integration:

  - Use Material 3 FAB (Floating Action Button) styling for any interactive elements shown
  - Progress indicators should follow Material 3 circular determinate patterns
  - Cards should have appropriate elevation (Level 1-2) with subtle shadows
  - Rounded corners: 16-24px radius (Material 3 extra-large component standard)

  Mood & Atmosphere:

  The graphic should evoke: calm confidence, scientific precision, gentle encouragement, personal sanctuary, ambient
  awareness, and premium quality. It should feel like a sophisticated tool that empowers productivity through
  environmental measurement.

  Technical Requirements:

  - Dimensions: Exactly 1024x500px (2.05:1 aspect ratio)
  - Format: 24-bit PNG or JPEG
  - File size: Under 1MB
  - Safe zones: Keep critical content 64px from edges (Google Play crops/scales)
  - Test on dark backgrounds: Ensure visibility in dark theme Play Store
  - No transparency: Use solid background colors

  What to Avoid:

  - Generic meditation lotus flowers or traditional zen symbols
  - Literal representations (microphones, headphones, volume knobs)
  - Overly busy patterns that reduce readability at thumbnail sizes
  - Text-heavy designs (visual storytelling preferred)
  - Harsh reds, aggressive yellows, or anxiety-inducing colors
  - Cluttered UI screenshots (show curated, beautiful moments)
  - Competing focal points (maintain clear visual hierarchy)

  Conceptual Direction (Recommended):

  "The Focus Field Transformation"
  - Left: Chaotic sound waves and environmental noise particles
  - Center: Large, glowing circular field actively absorbing/dampening noise with elegant progress ring
  - Right: Smooth, calm gradients suggesting achieved silence and focused productivity
  - Overlaid: 2-3 floating Material 3 cards showing key app features (session control, ambient score, streak progress)
  - Color journey: Vibrant teal → deep teal/purple → peaceful purple/blue
  - Subtle tagline: "Measure Silence. Build Focus." in top-left using Google Sans

  Context for AI Generation:

  This is the primary marketing asset for Google Play Store - the first visual users see when discovering the app. It
  must:
  1. Immediately communicate unique value (silence measurement + focus building)
  2. Feel premium and worth $1.99-$3.99/month
  3. Stand out in productivity/wellness category
  4. Align with Material 3 design language for Android platform
  5. Work at both full size (feature graphic) and thumbnail previews

  Create a feature graphic that tells the story: "We measure your ambient environment in real-time, create a protective 
  field of focus, and help you build deep work habits through compassionate progression."
