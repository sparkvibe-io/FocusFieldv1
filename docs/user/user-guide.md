# User Guide

## Getting Started

SilenceScore is an ambient noise monitoring application that helps you track and improve the quietness of your environment. Whether you're working from home, studying, or simply want to monitor noise levels, SilenceScore provides real-time feedback and historical tracking.

## Installation

### System Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements
- **iOS**: 13.0 or later
- **Android**: API level 21 (Android 5.0) or later
- **Device**: Smartphone or tablet with microphone

#### Recommended
- Device with good microphone quality for accurate measurements
- Stable environment for consistent readings

### Download and Install

1. **Download** the app from your device's app store
2. **Install** following standard installation procedures
3. **Grant permissions** when prompted (microphone access required)

## First Launch

### Permission Setup

When you first open SilenceScore, you'll be asked to grant microphone permission:

1. **Tap "Allow"** when prompted for microphone access
2. **Enable** if you want background monitoring (optional)

> **Note**: Without microphone permission, the app cannot function. This permission is only used for noise level measurement and no audio is recorded or stored.

### Initial Calibration

The app will automatically calibrate to your environment:

1. **Stay quiet** for 10-15 seconds during initial setup
2. **Normal environment sounds** will be used to establish baseline
3. **Threshold adjustments** can be made later in settings

- **Color coding**: 
  - Green (90-100): Excellent silence
  - Blue (70-89): Good silence  
  - Yellow (50-69): Fair noise levels
  - Red (0-49): Noisy environment

#### 2. Real-Time Chart
- **Live noise level graph** showing recent measurements
- **Time axis**: Last 60 seconds of data
- **Decibel scale**: Shows actual noise levels in dB

#### 3. Current Status

### Understanding Your Score

Your silence score is calculated based on:

#### Scoring Criteria
- **Noise Level**: Lower decibel readings = higher scores
- **Consistency**: Steady quiet environments score better than fluctuating ones
- **Duration**: Longer periods of silence improve overall score

#### Score Ranges
- **90-100**: Excellent - Very quiet environment, ideal for concentration
- **70-89**: Good - Quiet with occasional minor sounds
- **50-69**: Fair - Moderate noise levels, suitable for casual activities
- **0-49**: Poor - Noisy environment, may impact concentration

### Real-Time Feedback

#### Visual Indicators
- **Progress ring** fills and changes color based on current score
- **Chart line** shows immediate noise level changes
- **Status text** provides quick assessment

#### Audio Feedback (Optional)

- **Use soft furnishings** to absorb sound (curtains, carpets, cushions)
- **Position away from noise sources** (appliances, HVAC vents)
- **Consider white noise machines** for consistent background sound

#### Timing Strategies
- **Monitor during off-peak hours** when neighborhood is quieter
- **Track patterns** to identify your quietest times
- **Plan important work** during historically quiet periods

### App Usage Best Practices

#### Device Placement
- **Stable surface**: Avoid handling device during monitoring
- **Central location**: Place where you'll be working/studying
- **Consistent positioning**: Use same spot for comparable readings

#### Session Management
- **Regular monitoring**: Daily sessions provide better insights
- **Appropriate duration**: 30 minutes to 2 hours for meaningful data
- **Note-taking**: Record what causes noise spikes for future reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### App Not Detecting Sound
1. **Check permissions**: Ensure microphone access is granted
2. **Restart app**: Close and reopen SilenceScore
3. **Test microphone**: Try recording a voice memo to verify microphone works
4. **Check volume**: Ensure device volume is adequate (doesn't affect measurement)

#### Inconsistent Readings
1. **Recalibrate**: Go to Settings > Calibration > Reset
2. **Stable placement**: Ensure device isn't moving during measurement
3. **Clean microphone**: Gently clean microphone opening
4. **Update app**: Check for app updates in your app store

#### Battery Drain
1. **Background monitoring**: Disable if not needed
2. **Reduce frequency**: Lower measurement frequency in settings
3. **Close other apps**: Free up system resources
4. **Enable low power mode**: Use device's battery saving features

#### Low Scores Despite Quiet Environment
1. **Adjust threshold**: Lower the silence threshold in settings
2. **Check for hidden noise sources**: Fans, electronics, appliances
3. **Microphone sensitivity**: Some devices are more sensitive than others
4. **Environmental factors**: Air conditioning, heating, external noise
