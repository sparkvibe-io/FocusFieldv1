# Focus Field Documentation

Welcome to the Focus Field documentation hub. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for users, developers, and contributors.

## üìã Recent Changes
**January 2025**: Documentation has been reorganized for better structure. All documentation files (except the main README.md) are now located in the `/docs/` folder. If you have bookmarked links to `CHANGELOG.md` or `MONETIZATION_SETUP.md`, please update them to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/MONETIZATION_SETUP.md` respectively.

### üìå Current Project State (October 2025)
- CI pipeline stable: uses `dart format`, localization parity check, coverage (‚â•70%).
- Localization script refactored (no broken pipes; only fails on true key or artifact drift).
- Monetization scaffolding implemented (subscription tiers, paywall UI, gating). Free trial & analytics integration pending.
- Recent cleanup: removed committed coverage artifact; added `.gitignore` entries for coverage & Flutter ephemeral dirs.
- Large formatting pass applied across codebase (Dart formatter).
- Android emulator launch issues under investigation (Pixel Tablet AVD failing to start locally).
- Final product direction: Ambient Quests (quiet-first profiles, Ambient Score, Quest capsule, compassionate streaks). Mission/Habit docs have been archived.
- Implemented: Adaptive threshold suggestion provider (¬±2 dB after 3 wins/losses), debug-only long-press to cycle overrides, inline apply hint with auto-clear, and a 24-hour cooldown for suggestions. Unit tests cover wins/losses/neutral, override precedence, and cooldown behavior.
- Implemented: Minimal AmbientSessionEngine and Quest state providers; Quest capsule scaffold and ring subtitle wiring in progress.
- Next focus: move Quest application into the session engine (remove UI-side apply), expose a live calm-percent stream for ring subtitle, and add hysteresis/cooldown tuning behind flags.
